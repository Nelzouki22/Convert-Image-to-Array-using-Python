# Convert Image to Array using Python
Explanation:
Import Libraries: PIL for image handling and NumPy for array operations.
Load Image: Image.open(image_path) loads the image.
Convert to Array: np.array(image) converts the image to a NumPy array.
Print Array Info: Displays the shape and data type of the array.
Replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with the path to your image file. The script loads the image, converts it to an array, and prints the array's shape and data type. The actual array data is printed if needed (currently commented out).
